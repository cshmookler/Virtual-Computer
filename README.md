# Virtual Computer
A simulation of a reduced instruction-set computer. Made with C++ and OpenGL.

## Computer Specifications and Behavior
The virtual computer is designed to functions just like it would when made of semiconductors instead of code. The virtual computer has 4096 words of RAM. A word is 16 bits long. On startup, the contents of data/bin_data/rom.dat are read and stored in RAM. The virtual computer, starting at RAM position 0, executes instructions read from RAM. An instruction is one word (16 bits) long. It consists of an op-code (first 4 bits), and an operand (last 12 bits). The op-code denotes the instruction to be executed, and the operand is the information being operated on.

Instruction set list coming soon.

## Project Status
This project is in the alpha stage of development. Some key features are not yet present (access to peripheral devices).

## Compilation instructions
Coming soon.
